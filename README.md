# :jigsaw: Maze generator

This is a project made for [Data Structures Lab course](https://tira.mooc.fi/kevat-2023/) (2023) at the University of Helsinki, which involves implementing and visualizing algorithms for maze generation using Python and the Pygame module. 

The focus of the project is on the implementation and analysis of two algorithms that try to solve some problem. I chose the creation of mazes as the topic of my project and I chose Kruskalâ€™s and Depth-First Search as the algorithms. The user interface is kept simple to emphasize the functionality and algorithmic processes behind the maze generation.

## :books: What I learned
- implementing data structures and algorithms from literature and the "Data Structures and Algorithms" courses (TKT200011 and TKT200012)
- designing and implementing correct and efficient solutions for the maze creation problem
- analyzing and comparing different algorithms that solve the same problem
- translating pseudocode into Python
- writing unit tests for algorithms and data structures

#### Technologies
- Python
- Pygame
- Pytest
- Git version control
