# Week 3:

## What I did:
Last week I did not quite comprehend that I had only written user interface code that does not require tests. Because of this I made a bit of a confusing plan for this week in last week’s report. Clearly that plan did not come true due to a lack of code that is of core functionality and that is intended to be tested. So I went with the flow and continued on what felt natural.

    
**27.3:**
- Refactored all the code I created last week. 
- Added descriptive comments to classes and their methods.
- Pylint fixes.   
(3h 30min)
    
**30.3:**
- Worked on a feature where one can choose the grid size for a maze.    
(2h 20min)
    
**2.4:**
- Finished the grid size choosing feature. (This was a bit bigger implementation than I had planned timewise.)
- Started to construct needed data structures for Kruskal’s algorithm.    
(7h)

Since I mainly have user interface based code in my project at the moment, I haven’t started writing the testing document just yet.

My accomplished work this week does not exactly conform to the official plan on this course but I intend to catch up on the schedule in the next two weeks (holiday week and DL 4.-week).

## What was hard or caused problems:
My last week’s plan was not fit for this week and grid size selection -implementation was a bit more time consuming than I had planned but otherwise no problems this week.

## What next:
Next week I will start coding the algorithms and other needed functionality to integrate them to my code.   
In the process I will write unit tests and configure Github Actions for continuous integration.   
I will also start writing the testing document.

## Total time spent:
 12h 50min
