# Week 6:

## What I did:
This week I sent the second peer review and made changes to DepthFirstSearch class based on last week’s guidance session. 
I also changed the DFS's tests accordingly. For example, I solved the 'maximum recursion depth exceeded' problem, 
and made an adjacency list that makes testing the end result of a maze easier. 
I still have some tests left to create, but I will leave them for next week. 
I should also review the DFS class again, since I made a lot of changes there and some poor code quality might still exist. 

## What was hard or caused problems:
I did not struggle much this week. I continued to fix some problems in DFS class based on the notes from last week’s Zoom guidance.   
I didn't face any significant problems, since I had received great advice from last week.

## What next:
Next week I will finish all the main elements of the project and prepare for the project demonstration meeting. 
I will create more maze tests for both dfs and Kruskal’s algorithms. 
For example I still need to test the adjacency on both mazes, that a unique path is found in both mazes and that the Kruskal’s maze does not contain cycles. 
I will also update and finish implementation and testing documentations. Especially implementation document is currently in progress and outdated.

I think that the main functionality of my code is ready, but if there is still time left before the final deadline, 
I will think about implementing the following, helpful suggestion, presented by arolaeemil’s peer review for my project;
“Currently there appears to be no way to back down from the grid size choice made. 
Perhaps one could be quite easily added with slight modifications. Could even just be a button appearing after the images are complete.”

## Total time spent:
16h 30min
