# Week 2:

### What I did:
- Initial configurations (Poetry)
- Installed dependencies (Pygame, Pylint, Coverage)
- Created initial code structure

This week I started working on my project code by making some sort of base for it.
I mainly worked on initial configurations and pygame interface creation. A significant amount of time passed in the beginning with the code and its structure. Because of this I did not manage to start working on my algorithms just yet. I also struggled to finish all the requirements that were given this week. For example I did not have time to carry out unit testing or commenting on the code. 

### What was hard or caused problems and what I learned:
I learned that it would make things a lot easier if the structure of the code was well planned before starting to write code. This week I used plenty of time rearranging my code structure because I was too eager to start writing code in the beginning.

If I could change anything from this week, I would have written tests right from the start.

### What next:
Next week I will start with creating tests and coverage reports, since I did't finish them this week. 
I will also configure Github Actions for continous integration. After this I dive deeper into my algorithms and start coding them.

**Time spent:** 13h
