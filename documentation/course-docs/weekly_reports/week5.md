# Week 5:

## What I did:
This week I mainly concentrated on the first peer review. I also didn't have as much time to devote to the project as last week. 
I didn’t push any code related changes to Github. My main focus was on getting answers to my last week’s questions and working on these problems.

## What I learned:
I had a Zoom meeting with course assistant Hannu Kärnä and learned a lot during that guidance session. 
Last week I faced some problems with testing and now I got insights to them. 
Hannu Kärnä also helped to figure out how to fix my ‘maximum recursion depth exceeded’ -problem. 

## What next:
Next week I will update my project based on the help from the guidance session.   
I will also update testing and implementation documents. 

## Total time spent:
6h 30min
