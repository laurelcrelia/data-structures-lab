# Implementation document

## Project structure

At the moment the project has following files:    
- `index.py` starts the program.    
- `app.py` controls the switching between different user interface stages.    
- `dfs.py` creates the depth-first search algorithm.    
- `disjointset.py` creates the disjoint set data structure that is needed for Kruskal's algorithm.    
- `stage.py` helps different user interface stages to operate by initializing the screen, controlling the widgets and creating a pygame mainloop. 
  
In addition there is a `tests` directory which contains unit tests and `ui` directory which consists of all files that create the user interface.
