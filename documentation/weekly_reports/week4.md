# Week 4:

## What I did:
**6.4** (1h 30min)    
- Pylint fixes. 
- Studied the algorithms.

**8.4** (7h)    
- Started to experiment with the DFS algorithm.
- Created a DepthFirstSearch class. 

**12.4** (7h 30min)   
- Integrated first working version of DFS into my code. 
- Checked and improved the quality of all the new code I had made. 
- Created first tests for DepthFirstSearch class. 
- Github Actions and Codecov configurations.

**13.4** (2h 30min)   
- Tried to figure out how to test the dfs recursive algorithm. 
- Started writing a testing document and implementation document.

**15.4** (5h)   
- Once again tried to create tests for dfs. 
- Created tests for the DisjointSet class.

**16.4** (6h 30min)   
- Pushed some code edits into Github that I had made the day before. 
- Created Kruskals class and all the functionality for Kruskal’s algorithm.
- Created first tests for Kruskals class.

## What was hard or caused problems:
Making tests for dfs class because of the recursive function in it. I also have some pygame code mixed in both algorithms’ classes because I couldn't yet figure out a better way to allow the user to exit the pygame window during maze generating. This also causes problems with testing.

I would be happy to receive some suggestions on this.

## What I learned:
Once you have everything else figured out in your code, the algorithms themselves are quite simple to implement. This became clear when I added Kruskal's algorithm surprisingly fast into my code. Prior to that I had already finished one algorithm (dfs) and created a perfectly working disjoint set class which had already been tested.

## What next:
Next week I will create more tests for both algorithms. I will also try to figure out how to get both algorithms to generate their maze’s at the same time.

We also have our first peer reviews. I hope I get some suggestions on how to improve my project and/or the code in it.

## Total time spent:
30h
