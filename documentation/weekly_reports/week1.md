# Week 1:

### What I did:
- Chose a topic
- Repository setup
- Project specification documentation

It was hard to decide on a topic. I spent a relatively big amount of time trying to choose a topic and after that doing research about different maze generating algorithms.

### What next:
Next I'll dig deeper on how my chosen algorithms work and start writing code.   
I'll also have to create unit tests from the early on. 

Time spent: 5h
